The International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons (ICBUW) is a global coalition of 160 groups in 33 countries. ICBUW was formed in 2003 in Berlaar, Belgium to promote a campaign based on reliable information on depleted uranium (DU) weapons. Until 2018 it was based in Manchester, England, then the office has been transferred from Manchester to Berlin.
ICBUW campaigns for a ban on the use, transport, manufacture, sale, and export of all conventional weapon systems containing uranium (usually called depleted uranium weapons). It also seeks health monitoring and compensation for communities affected by the use of uranium weapons and the environmental remediation of such sites.
