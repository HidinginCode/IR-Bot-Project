The 764th Bombardment Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the 461st Bombardment Wing at Amarillo Air Force Base, Texas, where it was inactivated on 28 March 1968.
The squadron was first activated during World War II.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany, and earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its actions.  Following V-E Day, the squadron returned to the United States, where it was inactivated in August 1945.
The squadron was reactivated at Hill Air Force Base, Utah under Tactical Air Command (TAC) in late 1943, soon becoming one of TAC's first jet bomber squadrons.  It moved to Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas in 1955 and was inactivated there, when Blytheville became a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base.  It was activated in 1963 at Amarillo, when SAC replaced its MAJCON wing there.  The squadron stood nuclear alert status at Amarillo and deployed crews and aircraft to Southeast Asia before inactivating.
