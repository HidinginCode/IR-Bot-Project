The 1988–89 Serie A was won by Internazionale, who won the title comfortably by an 11-point margin over runners-up Napoli. Milan's triumph in the European Cup meant Italy would be entering two teams – both the two giant Milan sides – into the European Cup for the 1989–90 season. Relegated to Serie B were Torino, Pescara, Pisa and Como.
