The film stars Warren Clarke as Geoff Dresner, a retired safe-cracker determined to leave his criminal past behind, who is persuaded to come out of retirement to do one last job to clear the debt of his son-in-law, Terry (played by Martin Freeman), owed to a notorious loan-shark. However, things go badly wrong when a security guard dies as a result of their plan. Hugo Speer, Lee Williams, Orla Brady and Nina Sosanya are also credited as principal members of the cast.
Writer Richard McBrien said of the production; "The Debt is a story about a criminal, a detective and a lawyer and how their lives collide with each other. The idea is that all three men owe debts to their children in some way which affects the way they do their job." The first part drew 5.08 million viewers, while the second part drew 4.48 million. The film holds a 71% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Debt was released on Region 1 DVD on 7 November 2006.
