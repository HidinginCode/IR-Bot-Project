Treaty United Women's Football Club is an Irish association football club based in Limerick. The club was founded in 2020 in the place of Limerick W.F.C. following their financial collapse.  They play in the Women's National League, the top tier of women's association football in Ireland, and play their home matches at Markets Field, the same ground as their predecessors.
