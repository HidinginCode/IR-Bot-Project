Black Wings of Destiny is the second studio album by the Black metal band Dragonlord.
Almost all of the previous album's thrash roots vanished, replaced with pure black metal. Peterson also began extending creative control to the rest of the band, instead of writing all the music himself for this album.  This is also the first album where the band first appeared in photos wearing corpsepaint.
