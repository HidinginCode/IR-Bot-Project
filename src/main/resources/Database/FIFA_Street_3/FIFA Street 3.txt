FIFA Street 3 is an arcade-style sports game for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo DS. It is the third game in the FIFA Street series from EA Sports BIG, and is the last title released under the brand. This game was followed up by the 2012 reboot of FIFA Street, but that game does not have EA Sports BIG branding (it uses the standard EA Sports branding instead).
