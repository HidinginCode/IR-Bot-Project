Küçükçekmece railway station (Turkish: Küçükçekmece istasyonu) is a railway station in Küçükçekmece, Istanbul. The station was originally built in 1872 by the Oriental Railway. In 1955, the station was rebuilt as a stop on the Istanbul suburban commuter rail line until 2013, when the entire line was closed down for expansion and renovation. Küçükçekmece station was demolished as a new one was built just south of the former platform and a third track was added. The new station is expected to enter service towards the end of 2018 and will be a stop on the Marmaray commuter rail line.
