Cantonal elections to elect half the membership of the general councils of France's 100  departments were held on 21 and 28 March 2004. These elections coincided with the left's landslide in the regional elections held at the same time and also resulted in strong performances by the Socialist Party (PS) and its allies on the left, leaving the Socialists in control of a majority of departments.
