Star Drama Theatre Presents was an ABS-CBN weekday program which featured a mix of veteran and upcoming stars from the Philippine entertainment industry from February 18, 1993 to September 8, 2001.
Various actors and actresses from Philippine Movies and TV get a special line up in this anthology with different stars in each month. The first featured star was Nora Aunor.  Her stint was billed as a "TV comeback" after a brief hiatus. She and ex-husband Christopher De Leon did a notable episode which highly rated during its initial telecast.  After a 2-season stint of "Nora" the anthology moved on to featuring various stars ranging from award-winning actresses such as Elizabeth Oropesa, Dawn Zulueta, Lorna Tolentino; to younger actresses Aiko Melendez, Manilyn Reynes, Sheryl Cruz, Judy Ann Santos and Jolina Magdangal; and on the last years of the show it served as a venue for actors and actresses signed with Star Magic to showcase their thespic abilities.
