A restriction digest is a procedure used in molecular biology to prepare DNA for analysis or other processing.  It is sometimes termed DNA fragmentation (this term is used for other procedures as well).  Hartl and Jones describe it this way: 

This enzymatic technique can be used for cleaving DNA molecules at specific sites, ensuring that all DNA fragments that contain a particular sequence at a particular location have the same size; furthermore, each fragment that contains the desired sequence has the sequence located at exactly the same position within the fragment. The cleavage method makes use of an important class of DNA-cleaving enzymes isolated primarily from bacteria.  These enzymes are called restriction endonucleases or restriction enzymes, and they are able to cleave DNA molecules at the positions at which particular short sequences of bases are present. 
The resulting digested DNA is very often selectively amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), making it more suitable for analytical techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis, and chromatography.  It is used in genetic fingerprinting, plasmid subcloning, and RFLP analysis.
