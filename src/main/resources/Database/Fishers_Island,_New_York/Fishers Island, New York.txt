Fishers Island (Pequot: Munnawtawkit) is an island located in Southold, New York, United States at the eastern end of Long Island Sound, 2 miles (3 km) off the southeastern coast of Connecticut across Fishers Island Sound. Approximately 9 miles (14 km) long and 1 mile (1.6 km) wide, it is approximately 11 miles (18 km) from the tip of Long Island at Orient Point, 2 miles (3 km) each from Napatree Point at the southwestern tip of Rhode Island and Groton Long Point in Connecticut, and approximately 7 miles (11 km) southeast of New London, Connecticut. It is accessible from New London by plane and regular ferry service.
The island is part of the town of Southold in Suffolk County. It is a census-designated place (CDP). As of the 2010 census, there were 236 people living year-round on 4.1 square miles (10.6 km2) of land; however, the population rises to approximately 2,000 during peak summer weekends, as throngs disembark on the island from Connecticut.
