Litquake is San Francisco's annual literary festival. Originally starting out as Litstock for a single day in Golden Gate Park in the spring of 1999, it now has a ten-day run in mid-October, as well as year-round programs and workshops.
Consisting of readings, discussions, film screenings, and themed events held at hundreds of Bay Area venues, Litquake now features 200 events and around 700 authors, and draws over 21,000 attendees annually. In 2018, 80% of all events were free and open to the public.
