Death Before Musick by Amen was released on EatUrMusic/Columbia/Sony on April 13, 2004.  The album continues the hardcore and punk genres of previous albums and draws on heavy metal as influence. The album spawned the hit single and promotional video for "California's Bleeding."  Drummer Luke Johnson, who would join the band around the time of the album's release and tour, appears with the band in the photo shoot in the album's booklet but did not play on the album.
