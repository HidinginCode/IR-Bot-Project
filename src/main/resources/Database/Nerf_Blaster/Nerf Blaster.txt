A Nerf Blaster is a toy gun made by Hasbro that fires foam darts, discs, or foam balls. The term "Nerf gun" is often used to describe the toy; however, it is often used as a blanket term for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the Nerf brand name. Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms; the first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball and Arrowstorm. Today, Hasbro has produced over twenty unique lines of Nerf-brand blasters, which each line centered around a particular theme or type of ammunition. Moreover, Hasbro has also produced Nerf blasters based around specific franchises, including Marvel Comics, Star Wars, G.I. Joe, Fortnite, Transformers, Overwatch, Halo Infinite, and Roblox. Nerf blasters are available in several international markets, although some blasters have their names changed or are not sold in certain countries due to laws surrounding toy safety.
Most Nerf brand and similar blasters are packaged with a set of the ammunition it fires, and ammunition refills are also sold separately in greater quantities. Some blasters can also be customized with special-made attachments, which are either included with the blaster or sold separately. Many non-Nerf brand blasters are also cross-compatible with Nerf brand darts and magazines, in order to take advantage of the name-brand’s existing ecosystem. 
Nerf blasters have been acclaimed for their popularity, particularly among boys and young adults. Additionally, a community has grown around Nerf blasters, as competitive and casual “Nerf wars” are commonly held among enthusiasts in various forms, similar to Airsoft and paintball. A significant modding community has also formed among enthusiasts, who aim to improve the performance and accuracy of existing blasters through upgraded parts and different ammo types.
