The 1994 France rugby union tour of Canada and New Zealand was a series of matches played in June and July 1994 in Canada and New Zealand by France national rugby union team. In typical French fashion, (in that they are famed for their inconsistency), they lost to Canada, a "Tier 2" Rugby playing nation, and then became the first Northern Hemisphere test side to win a test match series in New Zealand.
France became the fifth and most recent team after the 1937 Springboks, 1949 Wallabies, 1971 British Lions and 1986 Wallabies to win a test series in New Zealand.
