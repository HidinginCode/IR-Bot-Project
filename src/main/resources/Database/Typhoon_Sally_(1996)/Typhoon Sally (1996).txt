Typhoon Sally, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Maring was an extremely intense tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage across southeastern Asia, particularly in China, in September 1996. Forming well east of the Philippines on September 5, Sally quickly intensified as it tracked westward within favorable conditions. The system reached tropical storm intensity several hours after tropical cyclogenesis was completed, and strengthened further into typhoon intensity the following day. On September 7, Sally reached super typhoon status shortly before attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). Quickly moving across the South China Sea, Sally substantially weakened but remained a strong typhoon before making its first landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula on September 9. The tropical cyclone's trek brought it briefly over the Gulf of Tonkin before making a final landfall near the border of China and Vietnam. The typhoon rapidly deteriorated inland and dissipated later that day.
