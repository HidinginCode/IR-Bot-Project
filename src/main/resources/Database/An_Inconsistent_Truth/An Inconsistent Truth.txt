An Inconsistent Truth is a 2012 documentary film written, produced, and featuring, nationally syndicated conservative talk radio host Phil Valentine and directed by Shayne Edwards. Valentine, who denied climate change and disagreed with the scientific consensus on global warming, interviewed people who deny that there is a consensus on the issue of global warming or climate change, some of which are scientists, about the validity of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth and the facts presented within. The film argues that global warming proponents keep changing its label, basing their argument on what Valentine claims is shaky scientific ground.
