Jean-Louis Trudel (born 1967) is a Canadian science fiction writer.  He was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and has lived in Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal before moving to Quebec City, Quebec in 2010.  He teaches history part-time at the University of Ottawa.
While he writes mainly in French, he has authored a few stories in English, published in such venues as Asimov's Science Fiction (January-February 2020), On Spec and Tales of the Shadowmen.  Other stories in English and other languages (Greek, Portuguese, Italian, Russian) have appeared in translation.
Most of his books, for adults and young adults, are science fiction, but a few titles may also be classed as fantasy.  A long-time contributor to Solaris magazine, he is also a science-fiction critic and historian.  
Under the collective name Laurent McAllister, Trudel and Yves Meynard have written three young adult books as part of an ongoing series, as well as several stories.
He has received several literary distinctions, including the "Grand Prix de la Science-Fiction et du Fantastique québécois" in 2001 and several Prix Aurora awards.
