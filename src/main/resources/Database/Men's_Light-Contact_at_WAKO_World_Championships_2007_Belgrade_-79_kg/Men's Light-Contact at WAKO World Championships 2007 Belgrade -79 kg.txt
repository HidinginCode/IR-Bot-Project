World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the fifth heaviest of the male Light-Contact tournaments falling between middleweight and light heavyweight when compared to Low-Kick and K-1's weight classes.  There were twenty-three men from three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) taking part in the competition.  Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Light-Contact rules.

The tournament gold medalist was the Hungarian Zoltan Dancso who won gold by defeating the German Stefan Bücker by split decision.  By virtue of reaching the semi finals, Slovak Martin Navratil and Poland's Robert Matyja won bronze medals.
