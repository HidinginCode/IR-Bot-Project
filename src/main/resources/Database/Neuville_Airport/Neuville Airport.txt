Neuville Airport (TC LID: CNV9) is a privately owned general aviation aerodrome operated by Neuville Aéro. It is located 16 nautical miles (30 km; 18 mi) west of Quebec City and 1.1 NM (2.0 km; 1.3 mi) northeast of the village of Neuville, Quebec, in Canada.
Built in 2012, the airfield, which includes a 3,000 ft (914 m) runway and a hangar is primarily intended for owners of light aircraft. Construction and commissioning of the aerodrome is hotly contested by a group of citizens, the town and the Quebec government, among others, on a variety of environmental and jurisdictional grounds.
