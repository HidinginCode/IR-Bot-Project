Mémoires sur l'Égypte (Memoirs Relative to Egypt), long title Mémoires sur l'Égypte, publiés pendant les campagnes du Général Bonaparte dans les années 1798 and 1799 (Memoirs Relative to Egypt Published during the Campaign of General Bonaparte in the Years 1798 and 1799) was a 4-volume series published by Institut d'Egypte in 1798–1801 (Years VI-IX of the French Republican calendar). A collection of writings, the books detail research during Napoleon's Campaign in Egypt, comprising some of the most foundational scientific research on the Middle East by Western scholars notably in the emerging field of Egyptology. A Paris reprint of the series was released in 1799–1803 (Years VIII-XI) and an English translation of Volume 1 was printed in London on 31 March 1800.
