A mixiote is a traditional pit-barbecued meat dish in central Mexico; especially in the Basin of Mexico.  It can also be prepared in an oven.  It is usually made with mutton or rabbit, but chicken, lamb, and pork are also used. The meat is cubed with the bone and seasoned with pasilla and guajillo chili peppers, cumin, thyme, marjoram, bay leaves, cloves and garlic. It is then wrapped in small packages made of the tough semi-transparent outer skin of the leaves of the maguey or century plant, which gives it a unique flavor. Diced nopales are often included with the meat before wrapping.
