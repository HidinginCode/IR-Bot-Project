The International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL) started in 1997 as the European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology on Digital Libraries (ECDL). The first DELOS Working Group, partially funded by the European Union, laid the foundations for the establishment of a European Research Community on Digital Libraries. The conference has become a notable European forum focusing on digital libraries and associated technical, practical, and social issues.
