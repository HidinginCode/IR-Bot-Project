Phosphate conversion coating is a chemical treatment applied to steel parts that creates a thin adhering layer of iron, zinc, or manganese phosphates, to achieve corrosion resistance, lubrication, or as a foundation for subsequent coatings or painting. It is one of the most common types of conversion coating. The  process is also called phosphate coating, phosphatization, phosphatizing, or phosphating.  It is also known by the trade name Parkerizing, especially when applied to firearms and other military equipment.
A phosphate coating is usually obtained by applying to the steel part a dilute solution of phosphoric acid, possibly with soluble iron, zinc, and/or manganese salts.  The solution may be applied by sponging, spraying, or immersion.
Phosphate conversion coatings can also be used on aluminium, zinc, cadmium, silver and tin.
