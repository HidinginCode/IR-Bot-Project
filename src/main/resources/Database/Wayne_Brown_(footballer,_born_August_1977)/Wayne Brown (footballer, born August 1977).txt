Wayne Lawrence Brown (born 20 August 1977) is an English football coach and former player who is currently manager of Isthmian League North Division side Maldon & Tiptree.
Brown began his playing career with Ipswich Town where he progressed through the club's Academy. He made his professional debut on loan at Colchester United in 1997, going on to make 40 league appearances for Ipswich. He also had loan spells with Queens Park Rangers, Wimbledon and Watford, before permanently moving to the latter in 2002. He made 25 league appearances for Watford in two years with the club, failing to establish himself in the first team. Brown was again loaned out to Gillingham in 2003, and once more to Colchester in 2004. He sealed a move to Colchester following his loan, where he made over 120 league appearances and helped guide the club to the Championship for the first time in their history in 2006. He was also named the club's Player of the Year for his efforts.
After one season in the Championship with Colchester, Brown moved to Hull City for £450,000, spending two years with the side. However, he failed to make a mark in the first-team, making 42 league appearances, though he did help the club to promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2008. He was twice loaned out by the club, to Preston North End, and Leicester City. During his loan period with Leicester, Brown was a member of the League One title-winning team. He joined Leicester permanently in the summer of 2009, but spent just one season with the club as they reached the Championship play-off places. Brown rejoined Preston in 2010 after leaving Leicester by mutual consent, but could only manage 13 league appearances in the 2010–11 season. After being deemed surplus to requirements, Brown finally wound down his playing career with local side Bury Town in 2011.
Brown returned to Colchester United in 2012 in a coaching role, assisting John McGreal in managing the under-16 side, before later being appointed joint-manager of the under-18 side alongside McGreal. Brown spent three matches as caretaker manager of Colchester in December 2015, although he returned to his under-18s coaching role following the appointment of Kevin Keen as manager. He has since managed the Colchester United under-23 side and was then appointed manager at Maldon & Tiptree.
During the 2020–21 Isthmian League season, with the season suspended due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Brown was again named interim manager at Colchester United following the exit of Steve Ball from the role.
