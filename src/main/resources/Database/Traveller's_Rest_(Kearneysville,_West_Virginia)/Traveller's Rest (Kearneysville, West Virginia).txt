Traveller's Rest, also known as the General Horatio Gates Home, is an historic plantation house located on Bowers Road near Kearneysville, Jefferson County, West Virginia.  Built in 1773 and enlarged a few years later, it was the home of Continental Army General Horatio Gates from 1773 until 1790.  The house is very little altered from that period, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972.  The house is located on private property, and is not normally open to the public.
