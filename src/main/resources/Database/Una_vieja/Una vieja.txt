Una vieja (Spanish: An Old Lady) is a one-act zarzuela by Joaquín Gaztambide for libretto (in verse) by Francisco Camprodón. It is based on a French opéra comique La vieille by Eugène Scribe and François-Joseph Fétis (1826). The zarzuela got its first performance on 11 or 14 December 1860 at the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid. It was regularly staged until 1940s and has been revived occasionally in later times.
