Buddhism is a major religion in Hong Kong and has been greatly influential in the traditional culture of its populace. Among the most prominent Buddhist temples in the city there are the Chi Lin Nunnery in Diamond Hill, built in the Tang Dynasty's architectural style; the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, famous for the outdoor bronze statue, Tian Tan Buddha, which attracts a large number of visitors during the weekends and holidays.
Buddhist organizations and temples in Hong Kong have long been involved in social welfare and education. The Hong Kong Buddhist Association with close to 10,000 members operates a dozen primary and secondary schools, and elderly homes as well as centres for youth and children in Hong Kong. It also runs the Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital, which was founded in 1971.Under the leadership of the former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, the Hong Kong government formally recognised the influence of Buddhism in Hong Kong. In 1997 the government designated Buddha's Birthday as a public holiday, which replaced the Queen's birthday holiday. Tung himself is a Buddhist and participated in major, widely publicised Buddhist activities in Hong Kong and China.
Academic studies and research of Buddhism in Hong Kong have thrived over the past decades. The University of Hong Kong established a Centre of Buddhist Studies (CBS) in 2000. The Chinese University of Hong Kong also has a Centre for the Study of Humanistic Buddhism. The Buddha-Dharma Centre of Hong Kong (BDCHK) was established in April 2012 by Ven. Prof. K. L. Dhammmajoti and his post-graduate students from CBS, with primary aims to promote the study and research of Buddhism through academic courses and publications, and to integrate Buddhist study and spiritual praxis.
