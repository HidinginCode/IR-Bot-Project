2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) is the organic compound C6H3(NO2)2NHNH2. Dinitrophenylhydrazine is a red to orange solid. It is a substituted hydrazine. The solid is relatively sensitive to shock and friction. For this reason dinitrophenylhydrazine is usually handled as a wet powder.  DNPH is a precursor to the drug Sivifene.
