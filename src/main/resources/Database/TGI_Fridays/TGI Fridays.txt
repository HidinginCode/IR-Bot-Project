TGI Fridays (operating in the U.K. as FRIDAYS) is an American restaurant chain focusing on casual dining. The name is asserted to stand for "Thank God it's Friday", although as of 2010 some television commercials for the chain have also made use of the alternative phrase, "Thank goodness it's Friday."
