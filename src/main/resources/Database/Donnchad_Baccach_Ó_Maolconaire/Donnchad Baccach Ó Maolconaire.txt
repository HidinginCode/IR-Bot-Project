Donnchad Baccach Ó Maolconaire, Ollamh Síl Muireadaigh from 1385 to 1404.
Very little is known about Donnchad Baccach. The Annals of Connacht merely relate that he was Ollam of the Síol Muireadaigh in history. Given that all known past holders of the office had been drawn from the clan Ó Maolconaire, it is perhaps indicative of some unrest that the next Ollamh, at least as far as poetry, was from another family, the clan Ó Domhnalláin.
