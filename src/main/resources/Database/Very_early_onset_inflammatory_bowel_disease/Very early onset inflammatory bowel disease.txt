Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) is a type of IBD which starts in people younger than 6 years of age. According to age we can distinguish more specifically two categories within the VEOIBD diagnosis - neonatal IBD (patients younger than 1 month) and infantile IBD (patients younger than 2 years old).
